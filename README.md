# ElixirConf

Repository for ElixirConf 2022 Machine Learning with NX Training

Download and install the Elixir [Livebook App](https://livebook.dev/#install). Run the app. Open the localhost location in a browser. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory. Begin with Lesson 1: Machine Learning.

TODO

Boomer, are you able to finish these?
- [ ] Deep Learning lesson? 4_NeuralNetworks/2_DeepLearning.livemd 
- [ ] Statistics lesson? 4_Statistics/1_Intro.livemd 
- [ ] Intermediate/Advanced example? 8_NxInAction/x_Advanced.livemd 

If not, I have an idea for a replacement of the advanced example -- a sort of DIY livebook setup with instructions for them to find a dataset on Kaggle and use it sort of fill-in-the-blank style. Not sure what to do about the Deep Learning and Stats; I can't do those justice in time for the training.

- [ ] Add Production section - not even started yet, but cover how to version a model? saving a model?
- [ ] Tighten both DateFrames and Series sections
- [ ] Add more "brain breaks" using [Paassaa](https://github.com/minibikini/paasaa), [Woolly](https://github.com/pjhampton/woolly), etc.
- [ ] Finish setup slides beyond the "notebooks" selection once the lessons are set
- [x] Review the Axon section for redundancy in other chapters (intro in 7, etc.)
- [x] Add "next" and "previous" links to the bottom of each lesson
- [x] Finish Tools of the trade section 
- [x] Tighten the Future section, add images
- [x] Give credit to tensor chapter, datafames, series, axon
