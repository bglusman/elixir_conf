# ElixirConf

Repository for ElixirConf 2022 Machine Learning with NX Training

Download and install the Elixir [Livebook App](https://livebook.dev/#install). Run the app. Open the localhost location in a browser. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory. Begin with Lesson 1: Machine Learning.

TODO

Boomer, are you able to finish these?
- [ ] Statistics lesson? 4_Statistics/1_Intro.livemd 
- [ ] Intermediate/Advanced example? 8_NxInAction/x_Advanced.livemd 

If not, I have an idea for a replacement of the advanced example -- a sort of DIY livebook setup with instructions for them to find a dataset on Kaggle and use it sort of fill-in-the-blank style.

- [ ] Tighten both DateFrames and Series sections
- [ ] Move the normalization of the scidata and titanic sets into a function? will need to run those notebooks in the mix 
- [ ] Identify and add "more info/hint" sections like in Iris Data section: `<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} --><hr style="background-color: #800080;height: 5.0px;" /><img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2212696-200.png" alt="Brain icon" style="width: 85px; float: right; margin-right: 40px;" />)
- [ ] Identify and add "caution" sections like: `<hr style="background-color: #EED202; height: 5px;" /><img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/1038260-200.png" alt="Caution icon" style="width: 50px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /><span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">text</span><hr style="background-color: #EED202;height: 5px;" />`
- [ ] Finish setup slides beyond the "notebooks" selection once the lessons are set
- [ ] Add section explaining EXLA and why it matters for big datasets/realworld problems (that could include some info in the Future and in the Prod sections)
- [x] Review the Axon section for redundancy in other chapters (intro in 7, etc.)
- [x] Add "next" and "previous" links to the bottom of each lesson
- [x] Finish Tools of the trade section 
- [x] Tighten the Future section, add images
- [x] Give credit to tensor chapter, datafames, series, axon
- [x] Add Production section 
- [x] Change the shapes to have `nil` in the first elem ({nil, 4}) - nil because we don't know how many batches we are going to have
- [x] Added Essence Brain Break to Classification section
- [x] Added Essence Brain Break to Reinforcement section
- [x] All explorer at 0.2.0
- [x] Update to Nx 0.3.0
- [x] Update kino-vega-lite to 0.1.3
- [x] Update vega-lite to 0.1.4
